<h1>REFLECTION-ESSAY</h1>
    <p>This page must contain a short text (500-700 words) describing the challenges experienced by the (one, several or
    all) members of the group when transitioning from upper-secondary school (or work-life) to university.
        Reflect on any of the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>learning to code, or</li>
            <li>being a student rather than a pupil, or</li>
            <li>managing the workload</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>being a student rather than a pupil</h2>
        <p>This being our first year as student rather than pupils, we have experienced a lot of changes. Many of these
            changes were quite unexpected as well. From the age of 5 we are thought the same subject, until we reach
            the 10th grade. After this we choose a few subjects in vidregående, but still have the same basic subjects.
            Coming into university, everything is new. Most of us have never learned anything in the field we are now
            studying. There is also a lot of new expectations to how we are supposed to study.</p>
    <h3>Life as a pupil</h3>
        <p>In high school we had a set schedule, where we showed up to the designated classroom, sat down on our spot
            and paid attention to the class prepared by our teacher. Then the teacher gave us a schedule of what we had
            to do at home and made sure we were on track. In other words, we were told what to do at all times.
            For us this is the biggest difference between being a pupil and a student.</p>
    <h3>Life as a student</h3>
        <p>Now we are expected to control everything ourselves. We decide which classes to go to, depending on what we
            feel the need to attend. In our field of study, there aren’t even may classes to attend if you wanted to.
            If you didn’t understand what was being thought, you must teach it to yourselves.
            All the responsibility for our own learning is on you. No one is there to make sure you know the curriculum
            of your field of study before the exams.</p>
    <h3>Relations with your teacher</h3>
        <p>The relation you have with the teacher is also very different. In high school I knew all my teachers
            personally. We would meet them in the halls, have personal conversations with them and meetings for the
            teacher to talk about how you were doing in the class.<br>
            In university, some of my teachers I have never even seen at campus. I don’t know where their office is,
            and I have never had I conversation with them. And that is not even their job. They are just there to teach
            their class and have teacher’s assistants to deal with our questions.</p>
    <h3>Corona</h3>
        <p>On this topic we may not be the best to judge, because we have never known university without
            covid-restrictions. Before the pandemic, there may have been more classes to attend and more
            interaction between student and teacher. But for us, most of our studying is at home, over a computer
            screen, on mute with the camera turned off.
    <h3>Being an adult</h3>
        <p>Also, a huge factor to the difference between being a pupil and a student is that we are now adults…
            This brings a lot of expectations to the table as well. We are now reliant on having a job on the side
            and have less time to just study. There are also more expectations to have we are supposed to behave. U
            s delivering a task to late is not acceptable anymore.<br><br>
            In conclusion, life was way easier before… hehe. But being a student is way more giving than being a pupil.
            We are now studying for what we are going to be doing for the rest of our lives, and the field we have
            chosen is something that genuinely interests us. So, I guess we prefer this life, it’s just a biiit harder.</p>
