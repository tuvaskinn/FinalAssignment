    <h1>The Accessibility of our page</h1>
    <!--task description-->
    <aside>
        <p> This page must contain a short presentation of accessibility.
            Up to 500 words describing how the group tested the code for
            accessibility using an automated test.
            <br>Also explain how you:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>checked, validated, and made coding-choices for universal design beyond what an
            automated test can do</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are welcome to use screenshots from the testing site and of your code.</p>

            <h2>3 step self check</h2>
            <p>To begin our accessibility check we started with a 3 step check on our code checking for:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Check alt text for images and other non-text content</li>
                <li>Check color contrast</li>
                <li>Make sure your site can be zoomed without loss of content or functionality</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These three test will make sure that the website is compatible for screenreaders and people with bad
                vision can still read the page.</p>

            <h3>Life as a pupil</h3>
            <p>In high school we had a set schedule, where we showed up to the designated classroom, sat down on our spot
                and paid attention to the class prepared by our teacher. Then the teacher gave us a schedule of what we had
                to do at home and made sure we were on track. In other words, we were told what to do at all times.
                For us this is the biggest difference between being a pupil and a student.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Life as a student</h3>
            <p>Now we are expected to control everything ourselves. We decide which classes to go to, depending on what we
                feel the need to attend. In our field of study, there aren’t even may classes to attend if you wanted to.
                If you didn’t understand what was being thought, you must teach it to yourselves.
                All the responsibility for our own learning is on you. No one is there to make sure you know the curriculum
                of your field of study before the exams.</p>

            <h3>Relations with your teacher</h3>
            <p>The relation you have with the teacher is also very different. In high school I knew all my teachers
                personally. We would meet them in the halls, have personal conversations with them and meetings for the
                teacher to talk about how you were doing in the class.<br>
                In university, some of my teachers I have never even seen at campus. I don’t know where their office is,
                and I have never had I conversation with them. And that is not even their job. They are just there to teach
                their class and have teacher’s assistants to deal with our questions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Corona</h3>
            <p>On this topic we may not be the best to judge, because we have never known university without
                covid-restrictions. Before the pandemic, there may have been more classes to attend and more
                interaction between student and teacher. But for us, most of our studying is at home, over a computer
                screen, on mute with the camera turned off.</p>

            <h3>Being an adult</h3>
            <p>Also, a huge factor to the difference between being a pupil and a student is that we are now adults…
                This brings a lot of expectations to the table as well. We are now reliant on having a job on the side
                and have less time to just study. There are also more expectations to have we are supposed to behave. U
                s delivering a task to late is not acceptable anymore.<br><br>
                In conclusion, life was way easier before… hehe. But being a student is way more giving than being a pupil.
                We are now studying for what we are going to be doing for the rest of our lives, and the field we have
                chosen is something that genuinely interests us. So, I guess we prefer this life, it’s just a biiit harder.</p>
